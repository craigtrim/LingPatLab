War College students focused on Plan Orange for potential conflicts, foreseeing a Japanese attack on the Philippines leading to a stand at Bataan Peninsula awaiting Hawaiian Navy support. Nimitz appointed Pownall to lead the carrier force in the Central Pacific Drive, sidelining Towers despite his combat interests. Plan Orange detailed strategies for various locations like Japan, Manila, and Pacific Islands, with Samoa and other key areas considered. McMorris replaced Spruance as Nimitz's chief of staff, valued for his reliability despite his appearance, aiding in headquarters' operations. Amid leisure activities and relaxed gatherings at the Walkers' estate, Nimitz's staff expanded to 245 members during preparations for the Central Pacific Drive, presenting challenges of maintaining personal connections amidst the growth and lack of diversity. Nimitz delegated exercise duties to others, like his assistant Bernard Austin, as he avoided physical fitness activities. Despite trying to encourage McMorris to exercise, Nimitz turned to different companions for hikes. Staff members often found ways to avoid Nimitz's exercise invitations. His focus on the Pacific front, alongside King's support, involved limitations in available resources and challenges in logistics. Amid logistical struggles, Nimitz valued Admiral Calhoun's logistics support, advocating for his promotion. Nimitz navigated supply issues and sought approval for enhanced shipping operations to maintain campaign momentum. Nimitz was cautious about involving women in uniform during WWII and selected Raymond Spruance as commander of the Fifth Fleet, despite their differing personalities. Contrasting views between MacArthur and King on war strategy arose, with MacArthur suspecting a conspiracy to undermine his Southwest Pacific theater in favor of the Central Pacific campaign led by King and Nimitz. Tensions arose over appointing new leaders for the carrier force, with differing opinions on candidates. To maintain harmony, Nimitz chose a different leader than Towers' preference, leading to strategic changes such as reassigning Mitscher and transitioning Pownall. The importance of these decisions during the Galvanic operation was emphasized by King. Debates emerged on fleet actions, contemplating resurrecting Plan Orange or adopting island-hopping tactics amidst multiple enemies. The looming anticipation of a major naval clash in the western Pacific was seen as pivotal in the war's outcome. While Plan Orange evolved into Rainbow Plans, its influence persisted due to historical events like Pearl Harbor and MacArthur's actions in the Philippines. The Central Pacific offensive gained momentum in 1943, reminiscent of Plan Orange, with successful operations. Nimitz carefully considered high command candidates, ultimately choosing Halsey for the Central Pacific Drive despite early hesitations. The vast American fleet, comprising numerous carriers, battleships, and support vessels, showcased US industrial capacity and Japan's ill-fated war decision. Nimitz expanded his staff to manage the growing fleet operations effectively. King's proposed Central Pacific Drive III aimed at swift advances to provoke crucial encounters with the Japanese fleet, with Nimitz leading the focus on the Gilbert Islands for Operation Galvanic within the reorganized command structure.
